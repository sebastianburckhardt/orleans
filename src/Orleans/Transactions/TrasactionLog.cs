    /// This class represents the durable Transaction Log.
    /// Olreans Transaction Log has 2 types of entries:
    ///     1- StartRecord: There is exactly 1 entry of this type in the log. It logs the
    ///         number of started transactions so far.
    ///     2- CommitRecord: An entry is appended to the log when a transaction commits.
    ///     
    /// Usage:
    /// The log can be in 2 modes.
    ///     1- When first initialized the log is in Recovery Mode. In this mode the client calls
    ///         GetFirstCommitRecord followed by a sequence of GetNextCommitRecord() calls to 
    ///         retrieve the log entries. Finally the client calls EndRecovery().
    ///     2- The log becomes in Append Mode after the call to EndRecovery().
    ///         This is the normal mode of operation in which the caller can modify the log by
    ///         appending entries and removing entries that are no longer necessary.
